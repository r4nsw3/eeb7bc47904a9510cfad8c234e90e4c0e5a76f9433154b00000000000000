  |   "SAMURAI SHODOWN" is a fighting game that was originally released     |
  |   by SNK in 1993.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The game features 12 swordmasters, each with their own unique         |
  |   personality. They will battle it out among each other before taking   |
  |   on Shiro Tokisada Amakusa in the game's climax. One of the unique     |
  |   characteristics of this game is the Rage Gauge which fills up as      |
  |   the player takes damage. Once that gauge is full the character's      |
  |   attacks do more damage, keeping the battles tense and exciting.       |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty,     |
  |   and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at       |
  |   that time. Players can also compete against each other from all       |
  |   over the world with their high scores.                                |
